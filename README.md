# Fraud-Detection

###### Project Type
Analysis and Research Tool

###### Questions of Interest
1. Are there specific patterns in anomailies in financial transactions?
2. Is there any significant difference between Machine Learning (ML) based and Deep Learning (DL) based anomaly detection models?
3. Supervised models require large amounts of data for training unlike unsupervised models. Is there any difference in performance between the two?
4. Do frauds happen more on credit card transactions, or mobile payments, or other sources?

###### Goal of the Project:
An application that will have two main usages. The first is to predict anomalous transactions in real-time and compare the performance of different ML and DL models, and different supervised and unsupervised models. The second is a visualization tool that analyzes the different categories.
