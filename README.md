# Fraud-Detection

###### Project Type
Analysis and Research Tool

###### Questions of Interest
1. Is a specific claim Fraudulent? Is a provider fraudulent?
2. Are there specific patterns in frauds specific to providers and medical insurance claims? 
3. Which providers are doing the most fraud? Are there any specific years or specific states where the number of fraud claims were high? (more insights similar to this).
4. What are the trends of claims across beneficiary demographics?

###### Goal of the Project:
The goal of this project is to " predict the potentially fraudulent providers " based on the claims filed by them. We will also discover important variables helpful in detecting the behaviour of potentially fraud providers. 

We are trying to build an infrastructure for the Government to identify fraudulent medical insurance providers and also get insights into frauds in specific facilities, by specific providers and in accordance with specific physicians. The Infrastructure will consists of 2 main parts: Modelling (comprising ML models that will identify fradulent claims), Visualization (comprising various different insights)
