# Fraud-Detection

###### Project Type
Analysis and Research Tool

###### Questions of Interest
1. Are there specific patterns in anomalies in medical insurance claims?
2. Are there specific providers doing the most fraud. Or is there any specific year or specific states where the number of fraud claims were high? (more insights similar to this).

###### Goal of the Project:
We are trying to build an infrastructure for the Government to identify fraudulent medical insurance providers and also get insights into frauds in specific facilities, by specific providers and in accordance with specific physicians. The Infrastructure will consists of 2 main parts: Modelling (comprising ML models that will identify fradulent claims), Visualization (comprising various different insights)
