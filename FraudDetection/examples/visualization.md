### Find patterns within training data to look at variables that have a correlation with frauds. 
----------------------------------------------------------
To find trends within  fraudulent claims, the user must initialize and have the application running.

Once the application is running the following should be done:
1) On the homepage, we have shown the relation of four features that can be observed with fraudulent data. 
2) On the prediction page, we can see the breakdown of how many fraudulent claims we had in the training data and the total amount claimed because of those claims. We can also see the distribution of the claims by inpatient and outpatient.
3) Click on the "Choose File" option and upload the "test.csv" file which can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mfbifE1_o0zJAhWNHki2JaFwySkKLv5g/view?usp=sharing). 
4) Press "Submit" button.
5) Now the visualizations would be updated on the prediction page for the uploaded test data to give an initial insight on the number of fraud claims detected by the model.

* Identify more such trends which can help identify fraudulent claims.
