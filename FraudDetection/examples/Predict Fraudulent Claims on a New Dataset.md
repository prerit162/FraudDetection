### Predict Fraudulent Claims on the Test Dataset
----------------------------------------------------------
To predict fraudulent claims on the test dataset, the user must initialize and have the application running.

Once the application is running the following should be done:
1) On the homepage, click on "Let's Predict" present under Prediction. It will open up a new webpage displaying an option to upload and submit test data at the top, the models and their performances, and vizualizations. User can sort the table in ascending or descending order based on the metrics. 
2) Click on the "Choose File" option and upload the "test.csv" file which can be found in our data folder in our repository or can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mfbifE1_o0zJAhWNHki2JaFwySkKLv5g/view?usp=sharing). 
3) Press "Submit" button.
4) Click on "Click Here To Download Fraudulent Claims" button to have the list of fraud claims downloaded on the system.
